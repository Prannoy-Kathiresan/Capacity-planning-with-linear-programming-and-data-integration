# ðŸ“Š Simplex Solver in MATLAB

This project implements a two-phase **Simplex Method** in MATLAB for solving Linear Programming problems with support for test cases and real-world production scenarios.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Two-phase Simplex (feasibility + optimization)
- Handles:
  - Infeasible, unbounded, degenerate LPs
  - Slack/surplus/artificial variables
- Built-in test cases + user input mode
- Production planning use-case (inventory-based)

## ðŸ§ª Modes

| Mode | Description              |
|------|--------------------------|
| 0    | Infeasible Problem       |
| 1    | Feasible LP              |
| 2    | Degeneracy               |
| 3    | Unbounded LP             |
| 7    | Production Optimization  |
| 8    | Custom User Input        |

## ðŸ›  Usage

1. Open `Simplex1.m` in MATLAB  
2. Run:
   ```matlab
   >> Simplex1
   ```
3. Select a mode (0â€“8) when prompted
